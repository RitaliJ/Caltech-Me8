**mancala** contains a basic calculation of the number of seeds with respect to a set of mancala rules
**explicit polynomial** shows how a trajectory can be identified and plotted based on absolute time and using explicit computation of the trajectory via closed form formulas at every iteration
**implicit polynomial** computes the trajectory based on the current update in time (dt) and information from the previous iteration. it essentially uses iteration to determine the next move in the trajectory and doesn't require closed form expressions to determine the movement.
